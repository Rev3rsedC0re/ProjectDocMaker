# ProjectDocMaker
The Project Doc Maker is a simple tool to document your android studio project.
There are 2 ways to use the tool:
1. Go to android studio to the class you want to add and click ctrl+a to select all lines, then copy the lines (ctrl+c) and paste them in the Doc Maker and click Add Class
2. Click on "load" and select in your project directory the directory in which all the java files are located.

Options:
You can save to docx using save button.
You can remove classes that were wrongfully included by writing "delete {class name}" and pressing execute in the command line below the loaded classes.
By clicking on a class in the loaded functions section, you can view details about the class (in the left text view).
